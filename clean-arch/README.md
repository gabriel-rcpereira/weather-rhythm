# Weather Rhythm API

The API Application provides playlist songs by the temperature of the places desired.

The rhythms will be chosen considering:

    1. If temperature (celcius) is above 30 degrees, suggest tracks for party;

    2. In case temperature is between 15 and 30 degrees, suggest pop music tracks;

    3. If it's a bit chilly (between 10 and 14 degrees), suggest rock music tracks;

    4. Otherwise, if it's freezing outside, suggests classical music tracks;
